## Drum Kit

This is a simple Drum Kit web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to play different drum sounds by clicking on the drum buttons or pressing the corresponding keys on your keyboard.

### Usage

To use the Drum Kit application, follow these steps:

- Open the index.html file in your web browser.
- Click on the drum buttons displayed on the screen to play the corresponding drum sounds. Each button represents a different drum sound.

###### Alternatively, you can press the keys on your keyboard that are associated with each drum sound to play them.

The mapping of keys to drum sounds is as follows:

- w key: Tom 1 sound
- a key: Tom 2 sound
- s key: Tom 3 sound
- d key: Tom 4 sound
- j key: Snare sound
- k key: Crash sound
- l key: Kick sound

When a button is clicked or a key is pressed, the corresponding drum sound will be played.
The buttons have a visual effect applied when clicked or pressed, adding a temporary animation to indicate the interaction.


### Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure and elements of the Drum Kit application.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout of the Drum Kit application.
- **index.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the button click and keyboard press events, plays the corresponding drum sounds, and applies the button animation effect.

### Drum Sounds

- The Drum Kit app uses various drum sounds in the form of audio files (.mp3). The sound files are located in the sounds/ directory. You can replace these audio files with your own custom drum sounds by replacing the existing files or adding new ones.

### Styling

- The Drum Kit app includes CSS styles defined in the styles.css file. You can modify these styles to customize the appearance of the drum buttons, the title, and the footer.
